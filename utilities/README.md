# Lab Validation System

## Overview

This directory contains validation tools for MongoDB labs 1-13. The validation system executes the **exact same commands** that appear in the lab exercises to ensure they work correctly.

## Files

- `comprehensive_lab_validator.sh` - Main validation script that tests ALL lab functionality
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Validation Approach

### What It Tests

The validation script executes the actual commands from each lab:

**Lab 1 (MongoDB Shell Mastery):**
- MongoDB version checks and server information
- Database navigation and JavaScript environment
- Administrative commands and shell helpers

**Lab 2 (Database & Collection Management):**
- Database creation and statistics
- Collection creation with options (capped, validation)
- Collection management operations

**Lab 3 (CRUD Create and Insert):**
- Single and multiple document insertion
- ObjectId handling and data types
- Bulk operations and error handling

**Lab 4 (CRUD Read and Query):**
- Basic queries and comparison operators
- Logical operators and field existence
- Projections, sorting, and cursor operations

**Lab 5 (CRUD Update and Delete):**
- Update operations with various operators
- Array modifications and upsert operations
- Replace and delete operations

**Lab 6 (Advanced Query Techniques):**
- Complex logical queries and date ranges
- Text search with indexing
- Regex patterns and case-insensitive search

**Lab 7 (Aggregation Framework):**
- Basic grouping and aggregation operations
- Join operations with $lookup
- Array processing and complex calculations

**Lab 8 (Indexing & Performance Optimization):**
- Index creation and examination
- Compound, text, and partial indexes
- Performance analysis with explain plans

**Lab 9 (Data Modeling & Schema Design):**
- Creates insurance claims with embedded data
- Sets up schema validation with JSON Schema
- Tests valid and invalid document insertion
- Validates try-catch error handling
- Tests embedded data queries and aggregation

**Lab 10 (MongoDB Transactions):**
- Executes complete transaction workflows
- Tests session management and commit/rollback
- Validates ACID compliance scenarios

**Lab 11 (Replica Sets & High Availability):**
- Checks replica set status and configuration
- Validates high availability concepts

**Lab 12 (Sharding & Horizontal Scaling):**
- Tests database connectivity for sharding concepts
- Creates sample data for geographic distribution

**Lab 13 (Change Streams & Real-time Processing):**
- Creates all required indexes for notifications
- Sets up activity logging and fraud alert collections

### How to Run

The validation script provides two execution modes:

#### Quick Test (Option 1)
Tests against your existing MongoDB environment:
```bash
./utilities/comprehensive_lab_validator.sh
# Choose option 1 when prompted
```

#### Total Clean Test Run (Option 2)
Complete environment lifecycle with pristine validation:
```bash
./utilities/comprehensive_lab_validator.sh
# Choose option 2 when prompted
```

**Total Clean Test Run includes:**
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 1**: Environment teardown â†’ fresh setup â†’ data loading
- ðŸ§ª **Phase 2**: Complete validation of all 74 tests
- ðŸ§¹ **Phase 3**: Environment cleanup

### Expected Output

#### Quick Test
```
ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT OPTIONS:
1. Quick Test (use existing environment)
2. Total Clean Test Run (teardown â†’ setup â†’ data loading â†’ test â†’ cleanup)

Choose option (1 or 2): 1

## Synchronization Requirements

**CRITICAL:** When lab content changes, this validation script MUST be updated to match:

1. **New Commands Added to Labs** â†’ Add corresponding tests to validation script
2. **Lab Commands Modified** â†’ Update validation script with same modifications
3. **Lab Commands Removed** â†’ Remove corresponding tests from validation script

## Why This Approach

Previous validation attempts failed because:

1. **Wrong Technology**: Used Node.js instead of bash + mongosh
2. **Wrong Commands**: Tested basic connectivity instead of actual lab functionality
3. **Mixed Syntax**: Tried to run MongoDB shell commands in Node.js context

This approach:

- âœ… Uses proper technology (bash + mongosh)
- âœ… Tests actual lab commands
- âœ… Provides meaningful validation results
- âœ… Easy to maintain and update with lab changes

## Maintenance

When updating labs, always:

1. Update the lab markdown files
2. Update this validation script to match
3. Run validation to ensure everything works
4. Document any changes in commit messages

This ensures labs and validation stay synchronized and students get error-free exercises.
